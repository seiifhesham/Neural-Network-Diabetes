**Analysis & Interpretation**

The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset presents a challenging binary classification problem due to its relatively small size, noisy medical measurements, and overlapping class distributions. The goal of this project was to predict the presence of diabetes (Outcome) using eight clinical features such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, and age. An initial exploration showed class imbalance and unrealistic zero values in some medical features, which required careful preprocessing to ensure meaningful learning.

During preprocessing, zero values in physiologically invalid fields (e.g., glucose, blood pressure, insulin, BMI) were treated as missing and replaced using median imputation. Feature scaling was applied using standardization to ensure all features contributed equally during neural network training. The dataset was then split into training and testing subsets using a stratified approach to preserve class distribution, reducing the risk of biased evaluation.

A baseline neural network was first implemented, followed by a modified architecture with increased depth and dropout regularization. The final model used a 64→32→16 neuron structure with dropout layers to reduce overfitting, which is common in small medical datasets. Early stopping was employed during training to halt learning once validation loss stopped improving, preventing unnecessary memorization and ensuring better generalization.

Training and validation curves showed stable convergence with no significant divergence between training and validation loss, indicating effective regularization. The final model achieved a test accuracy of 74.68%, which falls within the expected performance range (70–75%) for the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. Evaluation metrics and the confusion matrix showed a balanced trade-off between correctly identifying diabetic and non-diabetic cases, with acceptable levels of false positives and false negatives for a screening-oriented model.

Overall, the results demonstrate that the neural network generalizes well to unseen data despite the dataset’s limitations. The use of dropout and early stopping improved robustness without sacrificing performance. This confirms that the same neural network pipeline used in the lab can be successfully applied to a different medical dataset, achieving reliable and interpretable results.
